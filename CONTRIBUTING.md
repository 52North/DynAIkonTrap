## I have a question
You can check if your question already has an answer in the [FAQ](https://gitlab.dynaikon.com/c4c/dynaikontrap#faq) or [issues](https://gitlab.dynaikon.com/c4c/dynaikontrap/issues). If not, please do get in touch. You can do this by **[INSERT METHOD]**. Please bear in mind that we are a small team and it might take a little time for us to get back to you, but we'll try to respond as quickly as possible.

## I have found a bug
We're sorry that you came across a problem. We'd really appreciate you sharing information about any bugs and issues you come across with us by using the [issues](https://gitlab.dynaikon.com/c4c/dynaikontrap/issues) forum. Before you do that double-check that the issue hasn't already been reported by searching through the issue forum. If the issue already exists please comment on that issue, that way everything stays in one place and it's easier for everyone involved to fix the problem.

When you submit an issue please be as descriptive as possible. Include any errors (ideally copy and paste them) along with a description of the actions leading up to the error.

## I have an idea
Awesome! We are always happy to get suggestions for improvement. This project is maintained on a part-time basis, so we aren't able to guarantee a commitment to large-scale feature improvements internally, but we really hope that others can help out here. Having said that we will look at every suggestion made and consider spending time on it.

Before making a suggestion, have a search through the issue forum applying the ~suggestion label.

## I would like to help
That is great news! We are really happy if you're interested in this project, especially if you are willing to spend time to improve it. Before you start any work it would be worth getting in touch with us so we can discuss how you could help. That way your time won't be wasted and your contribution will have maximum impact. We will most likely be looking for help with addressing issues labelled with ~bug or ~suggestion.
