Software to be run on the camera trap.

To run the program start it as a module by running (with Python 3.x):
```sh
python -m DynAIkonTrap
```

This can be stopped by hitting Ctrl+C.

The software for this system has been designed to be modular and so individual modules can be replaced by others and, in particular, core methods can be updated and exchanged for the current state of the art.
